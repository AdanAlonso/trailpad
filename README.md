# BACKLOG (naming pending)

## About

Backlog for video games with Yii2


## To-do

### High priority
* App name!
* Stats per platform and state
* Virtual Console games
* Add timestamps to tables

### Low priority
* Automatic migrations when deploying to Heroku (instead of having to log in, run "composer install; php yii migrate"; investigate composer post-install-cmd scripting)
* Group game versions per console
* Get game covers through GiantBomb API
* User login in app (instead of http basic auth)
* URLs with slug instead of id
