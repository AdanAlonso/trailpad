## About

Backlog for video games with Yii2


## To-do

### High priority
* Stats per platform and state

### Low priority
* Automatic migrations when deploying to Heroku (instead of having to log in, run "composer install; php yii migrate"; investigate composer post-install-cmd scripting)
* Group game versions per console
* User login in app (instead of http basic auth)
* URLs with slug instead of id
* Platform aliases (short names)
* Page title is inconsistent
* Better readme?
* Allow manually uploading game covers, or choosing between alternatives from the api
* Game aliases (display names vs names to search in the api)
